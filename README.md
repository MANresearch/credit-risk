About MAN Consulting
Founded by Matheus Nascimento, a seasoned professional with over 7 years of
experience in the financial market, MAN Consulting stands at the intersection of
strategic business vision and advanced quantitative analysis. Matheus's expertise,
spanning credit risk modeling, macroeconomic forecasting, data pipeline
automation, and financial engineering (MSc from ITA, PGD from FIA Business
School), underpins our commitment to delivering customized, high-impact
solutions.
Our mission is to provide analytical intelligence applied to credit that oƯers:
 Statistical Rigor and Regulatory Compliance: We ensure that every model
developed adheres to the highest statistical standards, employing rigorous
validation techniques and transparent methodologies. Our solutions are
designed with an eye towards evolving regulatory frameworks (e.g., Basel,
IFRS 9), providing clients with audit-ready, explainable models that can
withstand scrutiny and foster trust with internal and external stakeholders.
 Speed of Implementation with Modular Deliveries: Recognizing the fastpaced nature of modern finance, we prioritize agile development and
modular architecture. Our solutions are designed for quick integration into
existing IT infrastructures, minimizing disruption and accelerating time-tovalue. We deliver components that can be deployed incrementally, allowing
clients to realize benefits rapidly while a comprehensive solution is
progressively rolled out.
 Measurable Results: Our ultimate goal is to deliver tangible, quantifiable
improvements to your bottom line. We focus on key performance indicators
such as a significant reduction in delinquency rates and associated chargeoƯs, optimization of risk-based pricing to capture maximum value from each
loan, and more eƯicient capital utilization by aligning capital allocation with
true risk profiles.
